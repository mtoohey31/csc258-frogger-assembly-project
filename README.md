# csc258 Frogger Assembly Project

`frogger.asm` is meant to be run in the [Mars MIPS Simulator](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/A). It uses the "Bitmap Display" tool with the configuration outlined in the comment at the start of the file, and the "Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator" tool.
